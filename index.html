    <h1>UCSC CUIP Success Story</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Tiancheng Fu, I am the Website and Communication intern in the UCSC Financial Aid and Scholarship Office (FASO) during the 2018-2019 school year. I am a sophomore computer science student who is affiliated with Stevenson College. My major is the reason that I decided to become a Website and Communication intern. I hope to become a software engineer after I graduate from university. Like other careers, software engineer requires numerous hands-on experience. Throughout my academic career, I feel the majority of my classes lack applicability. My internship gives me a chance to apply what I have learned in my classes into real-life application. Beside of my academic interest in my internship, the scholarship provides by the internship is a great way to help me to pay for my university spendings.</p>
    
<p>As a Website and Communication intern, my main project is the Website Accessibility Develop. The amount of incoming student in UCSC  has been increasing in the past few years, but the state of California has been continually decreasing its funding to the University of California System. The increasing need for financial assistance often causes long waiting time for FASO support. My project is targeting to improve existing FASO websites and add new websites to help UCSC students understand the amount of financial aid they can receive without showing up to FASO in-person. In addition, my project is aiming to improve the university faculties' accessibility to the resources in the Financial Aid Office.</P>

<p>The project uses the existing FASO websites as basic platforms and expands them beyond their current areas. The project implication includes adding new content and fixing broken links on the existing website as the support component of the project. The main website development focuses on student support websites and faculty support websites. Two examples of the main website development are the Summer Grant Calculator, which helps students determine how much grant they can get for their summer quarter, and the Department Award Website, which assists the UCSC faculties and staffs with processes of reporting scholarships, prizes, and reimbursements to students. The website developments involve heavily with web-develop skills and teamwork skills since I am requiring to obtain accurate information from other staffs in FASO in order to create website contents.</P>

<p>In conclusion, I believe the UCSC students, faculties, and staffs will be satisfied with the project because they donâ€™t have to call or come to FASO in-person every time when they have questions regarding financial aids. The biggest challenge I have encountered during my internship is the long waiting time for finding support from other UCSC departments, but I was able to solve this issue over time. Personally, I am really happy with my project as I gained numerous experience in web-developing and communicating with peers. I believe the experience I have gained during my internship will greatly help me in both my future academic careers and programming careers.</p>
